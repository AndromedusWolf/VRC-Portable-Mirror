# VRC Portable Mirror

## Overview
This is a portable mirror prefab that can plopped into your VRChat world. It allows the local player to bring a mirror anywhere around with them in the world. The mirror has three quality settings users can toggle between; High Quality, Low Quality, Transparent. There is also two sliders that will allow the local player to resize the width and height of the mirrors.

This is being made free to use by the community and you may alter and improve the package as you wish. All I ask is that, if you alter the package and wish to distribute it, that you do so freely. There is no need to credit me, you may do so if you wish however. What I would appreciate is if you leave the link to this package on the UI panel so that other people know where it was downloaded.
